of adjacent numbers separated by one space. Do this several ways:
a) Using one statement with one stream insertion operator.
b) Using one statement with four stream insertion operators.
c) Using four statements.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()

{
	//a
	cout<<" 1 2 3 4\n";
	//b
	cout<<" 1"<<" 2"<<" 3"<<" 4\n";
	//c
	cout<<" 1";
	cout<<" 2";
	cout<<" 3";
	cout<<" 4"<<endl;
	return 0;
}

2.18: Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, obtains the
numbers from the user, then prints the larger number followed by the words "is larger." If the
numbers are equal, print the message "These numbers are equal."

int main(){
	
	int a,b;
	cout<<"Enter your first Number : ";
	cin>>a;

a circle as an integer and prints the circle’s diameter, circumference and area. Use the constant value
3.14159 for π. Do all calculations in output statements
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
 float radius; // declaration

 cout << "Enter the circle radius: "; // prompt
 cin >> radius;

 cout << "Diameter is " << radius * 2.0
 << "\nCircumference is " << 2 * 3.14159 * radius
 << "\nArea is " << 3.14159 * radius * radius << endl;

 return 0;
 }
2.21: ) Write a program that prints a box, an oval, an arrow and
a diamond as follows:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{

	cout<<endl<<"\t****""\t*""           *""          *"<<endl;
	cout<<"\t*\t*""     ""     *""         **""       *   *"     <<endl;
	cout<<"\t*\t*""    ""       *""       **""     *     *"        <<endl;

2.24: Write a program that reads an integer and determines and prints whether
it’s odd or even. [Hint: Use the modulus operator. An even number is a multiple of two. Any multiple of two leaves a remainder of zero when divided by 2.]
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	int a;
	cout<<"Enter your Number ";
	cin>>a;
	if(a%2==0){
		cout<<a<<" is even"<<endl;
	}
	if(a%2!=0){
		cout<<a<<" is odd"<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
 2.25: Write a program that reads in two integers and determines and prints if the first
is a multiple of the second. [Hint: Use the modulus operator.]

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	int a,b;
	cout<<"enter your integers ";
	cin>>a>>b;
	if(a%b==0){
		cout<<a<<" is multiple of "<<b<<endl;
	}
	if(a%b!=0){
		cout<<a<<" is not multiple of "<<b<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
}

2.26: ) Display the following checkerboard pattern with eight output
statements, then display the same pattern using as few statements as possible.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	cout<<"\t* * * * * * * *"<<endl;
	cout<<"         * * * * * * * *"<<endl;
	cout<<"\t* * * * * * * *"<<endl;
	cout<<"         * * * * * * * *"<<endl;
	cout<<"\t* * * * * * * *"<<endl;
	cout<<"         * * * * * * * *"<<endl;
	cout<<"\t* * * * * * * *"<<endl;
	cout<<"         * * * * * * * *"<<endl;
	
	
	
	
	
	return 0;
}
2.27: Write a
program that prints the integer equivalent of a character typed at the keyboard. Store the input in a
variable of type char. Test your program several times using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits and special characters (like $).
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	char ch;
	cout<<"Enter any Character";
	cin>>ch;
	cout<<static_cast < int > (ch);	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	return 0;
}
2.29: Using the techniques of this chapter, write a program that calculates the squares and
cubes of the integers from 0 to 10. Use tabs to print the following neatly formatted table of values:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	int a;
	cout<<"Enter a number ";
	cin>>a;
	cout<<"Integer"<<"\tSquare"<<"\tCube"<<endl;
	for( int i=0; i<a; i++)
	{
		cout<<i<<"\t"<<"  "<<i*i<<"       "<<i*i*i<<endl;
		
	
	}

 return 0;
 }
